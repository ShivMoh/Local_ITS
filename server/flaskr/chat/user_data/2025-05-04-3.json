    "prompt": "Great, I'm excited to learn! For my first question, I would like to ask: What is an operating system, and what are its primary goals? (Topic 1)",
    "chosen": "\n   As a computer science professor, you can start by explaining that an operating system (OS) is a resource allocator that manages all resources and decides between conflicting requests to ensure efficient and fair resource use. You can also mention that the OS is a control program that controls the execution of programs to prevent errors and improper use of the computer. Additionally, you can highlight that the OS exists to offer a reasonable way to solve the problem of creating a usable computing system, and its primary goals are to execute user programs, make solving user problems easier, and use computer hardware in an efficient manner.",
